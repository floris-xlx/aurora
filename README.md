- KBC Bank (BE)
- Argenta (BE)
- Deutsche Bank (BE)
- Volksbank (NL)
- ASN Bank (NL)

## Usage

Aurora can be integrated with your existing infrastructure to automatically parse and transform documents. Detailed API documentation and SDK support are available for seamless integration.

## Environment variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

- `AURORA_SCRIPT_DIR` - Optional, if you are extending Aurora with custom implementations but don't want to alter the source code 
- `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` - any postgres string will work 

## Build Aurora (Ubuntu 24.xx)

### Leptonica and Tesseract dependencies
On Ubuntu and derivatives the additional dependencies can be installed by running:
```sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev libtesseract-dev clang```

On Fedora 30 the additional dependencies can be installed by running:
```sudo dnf install leptonica-devel tesseract-devel clang```

On Termux 2019 (Android, Android on Chromebooks) the additional dependencies can be installed by running:
```pkg install libclang leptonica-dev tesseract-dev```

## Build Aurora (Windows)

On Windows, this library uses Microsoft's `vcpkg` to provide tesseract.

Please install `vcpkg` and set up user wide integration or `vcpkg` crate won't be able to find a library.

To install tesseract
```
REM from the vcpkg directory

REM 32 bit
.\vcpkg install tesseract:x86-windows

REM 64 bit
.\vcpkg install tesseract:x64-windows
```

`vcpkg` allows building either dynamically or statically linked application

if you prefer dynamic linking
```
SET VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=true
```

for statically linked libraries

```
SET RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+crt-static
```
To run the tests please download the English trained data to this directory and set

```
SET TESSDATA_PREFIX=.
```
If you prefer to compile tesseract yourself (Because, for example, you could not get vcpkg to build using clang-cl.exe), you can set these environment variables: TESSERACT_INCLUDE_PATHS, TESSERACT_LINK_PATHS and TESSERACT_LINK_LIBS.

For example:
```
set TESSERACT_INCLUDE_PATHS=D:\tesseract\build\include
set TESSERACT_LINK_PATHS=D:\tesseract\build\lib
set TESSERACT_LINK_LIBS=tesseract41
```

## Run Aurora
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/floris-xlx/aurora.git
cd aurora

# Copy example env
cp .env.example .env

# Build Aurora from source
cargo build --release

# Run Aurora
cp target/release/aurora aurora && ./aurora
```
